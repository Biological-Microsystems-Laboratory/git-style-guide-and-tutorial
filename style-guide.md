Style Guide
==========

General Guidelines
-----------------

Use the file naming conventions and referred file types. Do not make add unnecessary file such as folders of unused photos or PDFs. Do not make unnecessary versions of files if you are fixing or updating them. Just save and commit over the same file (array.DWG, array1.DWG, array2.DWG...) Keep everything organized in the master branch. Make sure to clean up the develop or other branches before merging them.

File Naming Conventions
---------

file and folders should have simple and descriptive names.

All file names in lower case with no spaces. Dashes or underscores can be used to separate words. (File extensions may be upper or lower case) 

example:

	wrong: 

	This is a Part.STL

	Right: 

	this-is-a-part.STL

Preferred File Types
--------------------

* .MD rather than .DOC
* .CSV rather than .XLS
* non-binary STL file are preferred
